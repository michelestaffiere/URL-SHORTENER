# URL Shortener
This project is one of the design challenges posted on Front End Mentor.
I've gone ahead and built this page using React.Js and also intergrated Google's Firebase Realtime Database and Firebase Authentication to the project so users can now sign up if they want to save their links to the cloud and have access to them anywhere with a stable internet connection. 

## URL Shortener- Link shortener API
#### 
The API I picked for this project is URL Shortener by big lobster on RapidApi - The api instructed to use for this project was (and as of writting this still is) down and inoperable. 
The API can be found here - [URL Shortener Service API](https://rapidapi.com/BigLobster/api/url-shortener-service/)
