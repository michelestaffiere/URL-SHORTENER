# URL Shortener

This project is one of the challenges posted on Front End Mentor - the goal of the project is to complete a design conversion from a given template and to integrate with the shrtcode API. All assets are provided by Front End Mentor


## Shareaholic - Link shortener API
#### 
The API I picked for this project was Shareaholics Link Shortener API - The project brief instucts the usage of shrtcode's Link shortening API but at the time of developing this project the API was down more often than not so the change was nessecary. 

The API can be found here - https://www.shareaholic.com/api/shortener/

## Objective
