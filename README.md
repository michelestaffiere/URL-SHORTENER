# URL Shortener

This project is one of the challenges posted on Front End Mentor - the goal of the project is to complete a design conversion from a given template and to integrate with the shrtcode API. All assets are provided by Front End Mentor

As of 2023-10-18 the project is, I would say 95% completed. There are some features I still have to add and some I have planned as stretch goals. Feel free to watch the repo to keep up to date with all changes to dev and main branches.


## Shareaholic - Link shortener API
#### 
The API I picked for this project is URL Shortener by big lobster on RapidApi - The api instructed to use for this project was (and as of writting this still is) down and inoperable. 

The API can be found here - [URL Shortener Service API](https://rapidapi.com/BigLobster/api/url-shortener-service/)

## Objective
- Get more comfortable developing small scale sites using React.js
- Get more hands on experience interfacing and intergrating API's 
- Have fun.
